Hi, I'm a **Low-Level Developer** with Autism (specific interest in low-level programming), primarily C focused, with some decent knowledge about assembly (primarily x86_64) and some Zig notions among other things. I really like to reimplement the wheel to learn and better understand how it works. I'm also a big Linux user (Arch BTW), I pretty much customized my entire [environement](https://github.com/Malcret/dotfiles), including my editor ([Neovim](https://github.com/Malcret/nulVim)).

> **_NOTE:_** Most of my projects are private on GitHub, which explains the low acitvity.

My key focus include:
- **Performance**, writing code with performance in mind.
- **Modularity**, writing modular code, in a way that it can be modified and re-used without the need of refatoring (or only minor one).
- **Readability**, writing readable code without sacrificing performance.
- **Make it Work then Improve**, when implementing new features, don't try too hard to writing perfect/optimal code, but do it once it works (if needed).

I mainly use these techno :
